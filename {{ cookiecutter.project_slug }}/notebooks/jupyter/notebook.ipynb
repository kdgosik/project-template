    "- Use this notebook (`./notebook.ipynb`) as your landing page, and delete any other notebook stubs, such as `notebook.Rmd`. Supplementary material (such as external websites, additional notebooks, or figures) are allowed but must have a link from this page.\n",
    "- Keep the analysis self-contained by adding dependencies to the Dockerfile.\n",
    "- Save raw data in `./data` and processed data or figures in `./results`. Use [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to track large files instead of adding to the git repo\n",
    "- Use calls to data APIs instead of batch downloads when possible\n"
